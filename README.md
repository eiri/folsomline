### Missing persistence for folsom

## Synopsis

[Folsom](https://github.com/boundary/folsom) is Erlang metrics aggregator from Boundary. It's awesome for realtime metrics collection and simple statistical analyzis, but I was missing persistence layer that'd allow me to follow the *dynamics* of the changes. So I wrote **F**olsom **S**imple **P**ersistence.
